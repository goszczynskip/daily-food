 * React currently throws a warning when using useLayoutEffect on the server. To get around it, we can conditionally
 * useEffect on the server (no-op) and useLayoutEffect in the browser. We occasionally need useLayoutEffect to
 * ensure we don't get a render flash for certain operations, but we may also need affected components to render on
 * the server.
