/**

 * https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-read-an-often-changing-value-from-usecallback
 *
 * Modified `useCallback` that can be used when dependencies change too frequently. Can occur when
 * e.g. user props are dependencies which could change on every render
 * e.g. volatile values (i.e. useState/useDispatch) are dependencies which could change frequently
 *
 * This should not be used often, but can be a useful re-render optimization since the callback is a ref and
 * will not be invalidated between re-renders
 *
 * @param fn - The callback function that will be used
